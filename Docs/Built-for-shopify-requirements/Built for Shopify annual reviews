If the review doesn’t find any issues with your app, then no further action is needed. Congratulations, your app is certified for another year!

Anchor to Failed reviewsFailed reviews
If reviewers find issues with any new or existing criteria, then you’ll receive an email outlining those issues so you can fix them and resubmit your app. If any additional clarification is required, you may reply to the email to speak with the reviewer.

You have 60 days to fix any issues raised in the review and resubmit. Your app keeps its Built for Shopify status during the grace period.

If you don’t complete the required fixes and resubmit your app by the end of 60 days, then your app will have its Built for Shopify status removed. You can re-apply for Built for Shopify status at any time.
