## üö® IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED

### Critical Blockers (Must Fix Before Submission)

#### 1. Billing API Implementation (HIGHEST PRIORITY)
**Current State**: Completely mocked/fake billing system
**Required Action**: Replace with real Shopify GraphQL billing API
**Timeline**: 4 weeks minimum
**Risk**: App Store rejection guaranteed without fix

**Key Requirements:**
- Implement `appSubscriptionCreate` GraphQL mutations
- Create proper merchant approval flow through Shopify Admin
- Add real subscription management and tracking
- Implement 14-day trials for Starter/Creator plans

#### 2. Protected Customer Data Assessment
**Current State**: Unknown data protection level requirements
**Required Action**: Complete data audit and implement requirements
**Timeline**: 2 weeks
**Risk**: Compliance violations and potential legal issues

**Key Requirements:**
- Conduct comprehensive data collection audit
- Determine Level 1 or Level 2 requirements
- Request appropriate access in Partner Dashboard
- Implement all applicable data protection measures

#### 3. Security Audit Completion
**Current State**: Internal security measures implemented
**Required Action**: External security audit and verification
**Timeline**: 2 weeks
**Risk**: Security vulnerabilities blocking App Store approval

**Key Requirements:**
- External penetration testing
- Vulnerability assessment
- Security headers verification
- Incident response testing
