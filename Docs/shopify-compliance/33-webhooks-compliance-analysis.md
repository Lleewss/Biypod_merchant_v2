# Webhooks Compliance Analysis

## Overview
Analysis of Shopify webhook requirements for App Store compliance, including mandatory GDPR webhooks and webhook security implementation.

## Official Requirements

### Mandatory Compliance Webhooks
All apps distributed through the Shopify App Store must implement three mandatory compliance webhooks:

1. **customers/data_request** - Handle customer data access requests
2. **customers/redact** - Handle customer data deletion requests  
3. **shop/redact** - Handle shop data deletion after app uninstallation

### Webhook Security Requirements
- Must handle POST requests with JSON body and `Content-Type: application/json`
- Must verify Shopify HMAC header for authentication
- Must return 401 Unauthorized for invalid HMAC
- Must respond with 200-series status code to confirm receipt
- Must complete actions within 30 days of receiving request

## Current Implementation Status

### âœ… IMPLEMENTED
- All three mandatory webhooks are configured
- HMAC verification is implemented
- Proper HTTP status code responses
- Webhook endpoints are secured with HTTPS

### ðŸ”„ NEEDS VERIFICATION
- End-to-end testing of webhook processing
- Data deletion compliance verification
- Response time validation (30-day requirement)

## Webhook Payload Analysis

### customers/data_request
```json
{
  "shop_id": 954889,
  "shop_domain": "{shop}.myshopify.com",
  "orders_requested": [299938, 280263, 220458],
  "customer": {
    "id": 191167,
    "email": "john@example.com",
    "phone": "555-625-1199"
  },
  "data_request": {
    "id": 9999
  }
}
```

**Required Actions:**
- Collect all customer data from app database
- Provide data to store owner within 30 days
- Include order data if app has access to orders

### customers/redact
```json
{
  "shop_id": 954889,
  "shop_domain": "{shop}.myshopify.com",
  "customer": {
    "id": 191167,
    "email": "john@example.com",
    "phone": "555-625-1199"
  },
  "orders_to_redact": [299938, 280263, 220458]
}
```

**Required Actions:**
- Delete or anonymize customer data
- Remove customer from app database
- Handle associated order data deletion
- Complete within 30 days unless legally required to retain

### shop/redact
```json
{
  "shop_id": 954889,
  "shop_domain": "{shop}.myshopify.com"
}
```

**Required Actions:**
- Delete all shop data from app database
- Remove shop configurations and settings
- Clean up any cached data
- Triggered 48 hours after app uninstallation

## Implementation Requirements

### Webhook Subscription
Must be configured in either:
1. **shopify.app.toml** file:
```toml
[webhooks]
api_version = "2024-07"

[[webhooks.subscriptions]]
compliance_topics = ["customers/data_request", "customers/redact", "shop/redact"]
uri = "https://app.example.com/webhooks"
```

2. **Partner Dashboard** under Configuration > Compliance webhooks

### Security Implementation
- HTTPS endpoints with valid SSL certificates
- HMAC verification using app secret
- Proper error handling and logging
- Rate limiting and DDoS protection

## Compliance Verification Steps

### 1. Webhook Endpoint Testing
- [ ] Verify all three endpoints are accessible
- [ ] Test HMAC verification with valid/invalid signatures
- [ ] Confirm proper HTTP status code responses
- [ ] Test error handling scenarios

### 2. Data Processing Testing
- [ ] Test customer data export functionality
- [ ] Verify customer data deletion process
- [ ] Test shop data cleanup after uninstallation
- [ ] Confirm 30-day response timeframe compliance

### 3. Security Testing
- [ ] Verify HTTPS certificate validity
- [ ] Test webhook authentication
- [ ] Confirm no sensitive data in logs
- [ ] Test rate limiting and abuse protection

## Current Biypod Implementation

### Webhook Endpoints
- **Base URL**: `https://www.biypod.com/api/webhooks/`
- **customers/data_request**: `/api/webhooks/customers/data_request`
- **customers/redact**: `/api/webhooks/customers/redact`
- **shop/redact**: `/api/webhooks/shop/redact`

### Security Measures
- HMAC verification implemented
- HTTPS enforced
- Proper error responses
- Logging for audit trail

### Data Handling
- Customer data export functionality
- Secure data deletion processes
- Shop cleanup procedures
- Compliance tracking

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. **Complete end-to-end webhook testing**
2. **Verify data deletion compliance**
3. **Document webhook response procedures**
4. **Test webhook reliability under load**

### Long-term Improvements
1. **Implement webhook retry mechanisms**
2. **Add webhook monitoring and alerting**
3. **Create webhook audit logging**
4. **Develop webhook testing automation**

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk
- **Non-compliance with mandatory webhooks** â†’ App Store rejection
- **Inadequate data deletion** â†’ GDPR violations
- **Security vulnerabilities** â†’ Data breaches

### Medium Risk
- **Slow webhook responses** â†’ Merchant complaints
- **Webhook failures** â†’ Compliance issues
- **Poor error handling** â†’ Support burden

### Low Risk
- **Webhook monitoring gaps** â†’ Operational issues
- **Documentation gaps** â†’ Development delays

## Next Steps

1. **Conduct comprehensive webhook testing**
2. **Verify GDPR compliance implementation**
3. **Update webhook documentation**
4. **Schedule regular compliance audits**
5. **Prepare for App Store submission**
