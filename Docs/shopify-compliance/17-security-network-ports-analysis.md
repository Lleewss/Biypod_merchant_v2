**Category**: Security & Network Infrastructure

## üìä **CRITICAL NETWORK SECURITY REQUIREMENTS**

### **üéØ MANDATORY PORT SECURITY**
- **REQUIREMENT**: Must NOT expose any services publicly that aren't necessary for app functionality
- **SCANNING**: Shopify uses Nmap security tool to identify open ports during review
- **ENFORCEMENT**: Apps with unexpected open ports will be flagged and questioned
- **JUSTIFICATION**: Must provide detailed explanation for any publicly accessible services

### **üö´ COMMONLY PROHIBITED SERVICES**
- **MySQL** - Database should not be publicly accessible
- **Redis** - Cache/session store should be internal only
- **Memcached** - Memory caching should be private
- **Elasticsearch** - Search engine should be secured
- **MongoDB** - NoSQL database should be internal
- **PostgreSQL** - Database should not be public

## üîç **BIYPOD CUSTOMIZER CRITICAL IMPACT ANALYSIS**

    server_name your-app.example.com;
    
    # Redirect all HTTP to HTTPS
    return 301 https://$server_name$request_uri;
}

server {
    listen 443 ssl http2;
    server_name your-app.example.com;
    
    # SSL configuration
    ssl_certificate /path/to/certificate.crt;
    ssl_certificate_key /path/to/private.key;
    
    # Proxy to internal services
    location / {
        proxy_pass http://app-server:3000;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
    }
    
    # 3D model API (internal only)
    location /api/3d/ {
        proxy_pass http://3d-service:8080;
        # Additional security headers
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto https;
    }
}

# Block direct access to internal services
server {
    listen 3306;
    deny all;
    return 444;
}
```

## üîß **PORT SCANNING AND MONITORING**

### **Self-Assessment Tools:**
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Port security audit script

echo "Checking for open ports..."

# Check for common database ports
nmap -p 3306,5432,27017,6379,11211,9200 localhost

# Check for all open ports
netstat -tuln | grep LISTEN

# Check for processes listening on ports
ss -tuln

# Check firewall status
ufw status verbose  # Ubuntu
firewall-cmd --list-all  # CentOS/RHEL
```

### **Automated Port Monitoring:**
```javascript
// Port monitoring service
const net = require('net');

const PROHIBITED_PORTS = [3306, 5432, 27017, 6379, 11211, 9200];
const ALLOWED_PORTS = [80, 443, 22];

const checkPort = (port) => {
  return new Promise((resolve) => {
    const socket = new net.Socket();
    
    socket.setTimeout(1000);
    
    socket.on('connect', () => {
      socket.destroy();
      resolve({ port, open: true });
    });
    
    socket.on('timeout', () => {
      socket.destroy();
      resolve({ port, open: false });
    });
    
    socket.on('error', () => {
      resolve({ port, open: false });
    });
    
    socket.connect(port, 'localhost');
  });
};

const auditPorts = async () => {
  console.log('Starting port security audit...');
  
  // Check prohibited ports
  for (const port of PROHIBITED_PORTS) {
    const result = await checkPort(port);
    if (result.open) {
      console.error(`‚ö†Ô∏è  SECURITY RISK: Port ${port} is publicly accessible!`);
    } else {
      console.log(`‚úÖ Port ${port} is properly secured`);
    }
  }
  
  // Check allowed ports
  for (const port of ALLOWED_PORTS) {
    const result = await checkPort(port);
    if (result.open) {
      console.log(`‚úÖ Port ${port} is accessible (expected)`);
    } else {
      console.warn(`‚ö†Ô∏è  Port ${port} is not accessible (may be expected)`);
    }
  }
};

// Run audit every hour
setInterval(auditPorts, 3600000);
auditPorts(); // Run immediately
```
